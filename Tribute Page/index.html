            <strong>Bruce Leeâ€™s philosophies have inspired millions </br>
            of people the world over. He was a diligent journaler</br>
            and made copious notes on his thoughts and ideas</br> 
            on how to live life to its fullest as well as on his</br>
            martial expression. Bruce Lee also lived his</br> 
            philosophies believing that philosophies are meant</br>
            to be applied not just pondered. Though his</br>
            philosophies are numerous, there are several that</br>
            are core to his outlook on life and martial arts.</br> 
            Many books on his philosophical thoughts and</br>
            the inspirational way he lived his life have been</br>
            published posthumously.</strong></p>

            <p class="paragraph"> <strong>Lee Siu Loong was born in 1940 in San Francisco, 
            CA while his parents were on tour with the Chinese Opera. Ultimately 
            raised in Hong Kong, Bruce Lee was a child actor appearing in more 
            than 20 films. At the age of 13, Bruce took up the study of wing chun 
            gung fu under renowned wing chun master, Yip Man.</strong></p>

            <p class="paragraph"> <strong>Bruce left Hong Kong at the age of 18, came to the United States and 
            made his way to Seattle, Washington where he worked in the restaurant
            of a family friend. He soon enrolled in the University of </br> Washington
            where he pursued a degree in</br> philosophy. Bruce began to teach gung 
            fu in </br>Seattle and soon opened his first school, the</br> Jun Fan Gung Fu 
            Institute. Two more schools</br> followed in Oakland and Los Angeles.</br> 
            Concurrently Bruce married his wife, Linda and</br> had his two children, 
            Brandon and Shannon.</br> In the mid sixties, Bruce was discovered while</br> 
            doing an exhibition at the Long Beach Internationals</br> and a role as 
            Kato in the tv series The Green Hornet</br> soon followed. During this 
            time, Bruce was also</br> developing his own martial art, which he ultimately</br>
            named Jeet Kune Do.</br><i>(translated: the way of the intercepting fist).</i>
