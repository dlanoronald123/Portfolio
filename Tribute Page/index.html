                            CA while his parents were on tour with the Chinese Opera. Ultimately 
                            raised in Hong Kong, Bruce Lee was a child actor appearing in more 
                            than 20 films. At the age of 13, Bruce took up the study of wing chun 
                            gung fu under renowned wing chun master, Yip Man.</strong></p>
                
                            <p class="paragraph"> <strong>Bruce left Hong Kong at the age of 18, 
                            came to the United States and 
                            made his way to Seattle, Washington where he worked in the restaurant
                            of a family friend. He soon enrolled in the University of Washington
                            where he pursued a degree in philosophy. Bruce began to teach gung 
                            fu in Seattle and soon opened his first school, the Jun Fan Gung Fu 
                            Institute. Two more school followed in Oakland and Los Angeles. 
                            Concurrently Bruce married his wife, Linda and had his two children, 
                            Brandon and Shannon. In the mid sixties, Bruce was discovered while
                            doing an exhibition at the Long Beach Internationals and a role as 
                            Kato in the tv series The Green Hornet soon followed. During this 
                            time, Bruce was also developing his own martial art, which he ultimately
                            named Jeet Kune Do.<i>(translated: the way of the intercepting fist)</i>...

                        of people the world over. He was a diligent journaler
                        and made copious notes on his thoughts and ideas
                        on how to live life to its fullest as well as on his
                        martial expression. Bruce Lee also lived his
                        philosophies believing that philosophies are meant
                        to be applied not just pondered. Though his
                        philosophies are numerous, there are several that
                        are core to his outlook on life and martial arts.
                        Many books on his philosophical thoughts and
                        the inspirational way he lived his life have been
                        published posthumously.</strong></p>
